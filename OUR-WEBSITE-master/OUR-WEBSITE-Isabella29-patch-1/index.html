<h3>Nourishing Nutella</h3>

<br>

<p>Cook Time: 25minutes. Equipement: Food Processor and a jar.</p>

<br>

<p>Always been a fan of Nutella but felt a bit bloated after indulging or simply confused when reading the ingredients? Look no further and try this absolute delish, perfect for the whole family!

</p>

<br>

<p>To make one jar of this amazing nourishing Nutella, you should first gather all the ingredients:</p>

<li class=”product item”> 2 cups of hazelnuts</li>

<li class=”product item”> 1/2 a cup of water</li>

<li class=”product item”> 1/2 a cup of maple syrup</li>

<li class=”product item”> 3 tablespoons of raw cacao powder</li>

<br>

<p>With the help of an adult, warm up the oven, and bake the hazelnuts at 180C for about ten minutes. Once the time is up, <strong>put your oven gloves on</strong> and carefully take the hazelnuts out of the oven. They should look golden to brown! Allow them to cool before proceeding to the next step. Too warm, it may damaged your food processor.</p>

<br>

<p>Place the hazelnuts in your food processor. Blend them for about ten minutes, until they break down <strong>completely</strong> and look like flour.</p>

<br>

<p>Next step is the fun one: add the maple syrup, the cacao, and blend again until it's properly mixed together. It is starting to get in shape...</p>

<br>

<p>Now, you only have to incorporate the water into the mix. Make sure the water is cold enough (it will help stick all the ingredients together). Pour it gradually (you can use a spoon to measure how much you are putting in) until it comes to you prefered shape and consistency.</p>

<br>

<p>TADAAAAM. Enjoy. Do it again.</p>




<h3>Pizza Crust</h3>

<br>

<p>Time: 50 minutes. Equipement: Food Processor, a baking tray and some baking paper.</p>

</p>To make two pizzas, go into your fridge and cupboards and gather:</p>

<li class=”product item”> 1 cauliflower</li>

<li class=”product item”> 2 eggs</li>

<li class=”product item”> sea salt</li>

<li class=”product item”> 1 tbsp of oregano</li>

<li class=”product item”> 3 table spoon of quinoa flour (or buckwheat flour or ground almonds)</li>

<li class=”product item”> 1 can of tomatoes</li>

<li class=”product item”> 1 tsp of dried rosemary</li>

<li class=”product item”> 1 white onion</li>

<li class=”product item”> coconut oil</li>

<li class=”product item”> 100g rocket</li>

<li class=”product item”> 100g sun-dried tomatoe</li>

<br>

<p>First, set your oven to 180ºC.</p>

<p>With the help on an adult, cut off the green stalks of your cauliflower. Cut it up into piece to fit into your food processor and pulse it until it is finely pulsed. It should be smaller than rice, but not quite flour.</p>

<p>If you don’t have a food processor chop it up with a knife, be patient and prepare to get your kitchen messy!</p>

<br>

<p>Once you have done this pop the chopped cauliflower in a bowl with the eggs, a large pinch of salt, the oregano and gluten free flour.</p>

<br>

<p>Mix together to form a dough and split into two. Place one half  on baking paper and flatten out with a spoon or spatula until you form a circle just under 1cm high. Repeat with other half.</p>

<br>

<p>Melt 2 tsp of coconut oil on a medium heat and brush the oil over the pizza base.</p>

<br>

<p>Place them both in the oven to cook for 20 mins.</p>

<br>

<p>Make the topping by cutting the white onion up very small, sauté it is 1 TBSP of coconut oil with the rosemary on a medium heat with a pinch of sea salt for 5 minutes.</p>

<br>

<p>Add in the can of tomatoes and cook for another 5-10 minutes. By this time it will be time to take the base’s out.</pr>

<br>

<p>Poor the tomato mix on top and cook for another 5 minutes until the edges crisp (but watch out so it doesn’t burn)</p>

<br>

<p>Take them out and throw the rocket and sun-dried tomatoes on evenly.</p>

<br>

<p>You can add many other yummy toppings on : sweetcorn, sliced mushrooms, chopped chicken, parma ham, fresh basil leaves, olive oil, sprinkle of salt and pepper, nuts…</p>
