<h3>Nourishing Nutella</h3>

<br>

<p><strong>Cook Time:</strong> 25minutes.<br> <strong>Equipment:</strong> Food Processor and a jar.</p>

<br>

<p>Always been a fan of Nutella but felt a bit bloated after indulging or simply confused when reading the ingredients? Look no further and try this absolute delish, perfect for the whole family!

</p>

<br>

<p>To make one jar of this amazing nourishing Nutella, you should first gather all the ingredients:</p>

<li class=”product item”> 2 cups of hazelnuts</li>

<li class=”product item”> 1/2 a cup of water</li>

<li class=”product item”> 1/2 a cup of maple syrup</li>

<li class=”product item”> 3 tablespoons of raw cacao powder</li>

<br>

<p>With the help of an adult, warm up the oven, and bake the hazelnuts at 180C for about ten minutes. Once the time is up, <strong>put your oven gloves on</strong> and carefully take the hazelnuts out of the oven. They should look golden to brown! Allow them to cool before proceeding to the next step. Too warm, it may damaged your food processor.</p>

<br>

<p>Place the hazelnuts in your food processor. Blend them for about ten minutes, until they break down <strong>completely</strong> and look like flour.</p>

<br>

<p>Next step is the fun one: add the maple syrup, the cacao, and blend again until it's properly mixed together. It is starting to get in shape...</p>

<br>

<p>Now, you only have to incorporate the water into the mix. Make sure the water is cold enough (it will help stick all the ingredients together). Pour it gradually (you can use a spoon to measure how much you are putting in) until it comes to you prefered shape and consistency.</p>

<br>

<p>TADAAAAM. Enjoy. Do it again.</p>
